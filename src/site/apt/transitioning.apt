Trasitioning from old version of Robot Framework Maven Plugin

* Introduction

    This plugin was forked from
    {{{http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-maven-plugin}http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-maven-plugin}}.
    For the most part this new plugin works as a drop in replacement for the old version, but there are a few changes
    needed to the configuration. This page describes the changes needed to move to this new version.

* Executive summary

    Change the <<<groupId>>> to <org.robotframework> and update the version number. Unless you use
    {{{./libdoc-mojo.html}libdoc}}, thats all you need.

+---
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.robotframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>robotframework-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.8</version>
  </plugin>
+---

    Below the changes in more detail.

* New groupId and version

    The original plugin was distributed with groupId <<<com.googlecode.robotframework-maven-plugin>>>. This has been changed
    to <<<org.robotframework>>>. The versioning starts in this new plugin from version 1.0.0
    (so version 1.0.0 of this plugin is newer than version 1.1.2 of the old version).


* Configuration changes

    Configuration of the run target has not been changed, but {{{./libdoc-mojo.html}libdoc}} configuration is now given
    in a separate <<<libdoc>>> element. See example below.
